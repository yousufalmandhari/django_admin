Create and customize your Django admin site to manage the content of an onlinecourse app

Concepts covered:
1) Django admin site: A built-in feature of the Django web framework that serves as an interface and allows authorized users to perform various management operations on the data stored in the application’s database.

2) Superuser: A user account with administrative privileges that allows superusers to perform administrative tasks and manage the application’s data.

3) Admin class: A class that helps fine-tune the behavior, appearance, and functionality of models within the Django admin site.

4) Inline class: Allow you to include related model instances in the same page/form as the parent model, instead of switching between different forms or screens.
